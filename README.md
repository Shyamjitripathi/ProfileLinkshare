As a developer, we use various platform for our use and when we want to share their links in one place we take help of sites like [BioLink](https://bio.link/), [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) and many more. <br>
So, one day I was scrolling Linkedin and was attracted by this biolink profile [Roadsidecoder](https://bio.link/roadsidecoder) and I decided to build the same thing for me which will have same appearance without a tracker.

<div class="home">                         "Parent Div"
  <div class="overlay">                    "Masking layer between parent and home-content"
     <div class="home-content">            "Div holding content"
     </div>
  </div
</div>
```
